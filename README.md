## Content

This repository contains the implementation of the theory derived and presented in the paper "Efficient dynamic modal load reconstruction using physics-informed Gaussian processes based on frequency-sparse Fourier basis functions", published in the Journal of Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing.

A base example for the force reconstruction in a single degree of freedom system is provided in `ForceReconstruction_SDOF.m`.
